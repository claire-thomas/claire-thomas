<strong>Welcome!</strong>

Claire is a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at University of Pittsburgh. Her research focuses on molecular and genetic risk factors in field of cancer epidemiology. Her primary advisor is [Dr. Jian-Min Yuan](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/jian-min-yuan). She received her BS and MPH from Boston University before moving to Pittsburgh. Her dissertation work involves molecular exposures such as bile acids and cytokines as well as a polygenic risk score for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in association with hepatocellular carcinoma risk. Her goal is to become an academic researcher in molecular and genetic epidemiology of cancer and identify biomarkers to improve risk stratification and early detection of cancer.
