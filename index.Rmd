Seriously, I am happy you came to visit. I love building things that people want to look at even if they only stop by for a minute or two. 

#### Want to make your own Website?

It's easier than you'd think. I love teaching others too, so if you're still with me I can show you how to make your own website that you can put anything from blogs to links to other projects to just embedded apps and videos.

All you have to do is follow one chapter of Yihui Xie's excellent documentation in the R Markdown Definitive guide here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/websites.html

Or if you prefer pithy commentary, feel free to follow the tutorial on my Medium article (MARSHALL DON'T FORGET TO WRITE THE MEDIUM ARTICLE AAARGG)

If you'd like to clone my [repo](https://github.com/mpkrass7/mk_website) as an example go right ahead!

### About me
I'm a Pythonista, R Pirate, Machine Learning Enthusiast, SQL Monkey, and Data Nerd. I'm also an expert with some BI tools like Tableau and Alteryx but I tell everyone I hate using them because I think coding is more fun.
